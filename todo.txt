proper scoping of variables
function parameters
function return values (how does this work with go? might have to remove go altogether, which could be difficult)

objects
	Probally much like functions, except consists of two sub nodes, a block of function prototypes and a block of data members
		The C code generator would turn this into a struct functions that take a struct as the first parameter.
			Would use scoping to determine the correct variable at build time.
		Unless we make all this visiable and go Python type here...
			It really does make conversion simple...
